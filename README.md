# Restaurant Management System - Group Project

This is our final project for the *Mobile Application Development* course. We have developed a web-based system that helps a restaurant manage its menu and orders digitally. The system is fully responsive and works on both mobile and desktop screens.

   * *Role:* Security & Session Management.
   * *Work Done:* Implemented security checks using SessionStorage. Ensured that only logged-in Admins can access the management dashboard and handled user authentication validation.

   * *Role:* QA Testing & Documentation.
   * *Work Done:* Conducted system testing to find and fix bugs. Managed the project documentation, including the README file and the final Report.pdf uploaded to this repository.

## 🛠 Technical Overview
* *Frontend:* Built with HTML5 and CSS3. We used a mobile-first approach to meet the course requirements for responsiveness.
* *Database:* Instead of a traditional server, we used the *Web Storage API (LocalStorage)*. This allows the menu and orders to be saved directly in the browser.
* *Security:* We used sessionStorage to protect the admin.html page. If a user is not logged in as an admin, the system redirects them to the login page.

## 📂 Repository Files
* index.html - Login and Registration portal.
* menu.html - Customer menu and ordering interface.
* admin.html - Admin dashboard for managing food items.
